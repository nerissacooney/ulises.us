[Paper Cuts](http://clocktower.org/series/paper-cuts), the zine, DIY, and small press reading program on [Clocktower Radio](http://clocktower.org/radio), is taking the show on the road with a series of events at bookstores and alternative spaces.  Each event will feature writers, zinesters, artists, and performers who typically share their work in print, on paper, and in small editions.  Think of it as a traveling micro-zine tour.  Come to hear great work and talk with the readers about zines and small press publications.
