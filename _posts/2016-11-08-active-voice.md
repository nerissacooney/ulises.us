Active Voice considers the voice in relation to listening, language, and political agency through a series of programs, artworks, readings, events, and curated publications from contributors Mark Beasley, Hannah Black, and Steffani Jemison. Active Voice seeks to address the performative and embodied potential of the voice and its ability to reify and limit political and social realities.
