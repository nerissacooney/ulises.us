Join Ulises for a book launch with artist Becky Suss. Enjoy libations, snacks and company celebrating the release of the ICA exhibition catalogue "Beck Suss." 

In the fall of 2015, Suss presented selections from her most recent body of work in her first solo museum exhibition curated by ICA's Laporte Associate Curator, Kate Kraczon. Released in 2017, the fully illustrated catalogue for this exhibition includes an extended interview of Suss by Kate Kraczon. 

"Meditative, large-scale paintings augmented by smaller studies in oil and ceramic reimagine the domestic spaces of her relatives with a focus on her late grandparents’ mid-century suburban home. The flattened architecture and exaggerated perspective of Suss’s canvases memorialize their collected art and objects through an intimate, archeological process that opens familial narrative to questions of class, politics, and religion."

Becky Suss was born in 1980 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where she is currently based. She received an MFA from the University of California, Berkeley, a BA from Williams College, and in 2013 attended the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture. In addition to ICA Philadelphia, Suss’ work has been exhibited at the Woodmere Art Museum, Pennsylvania, the Berkeley Art Museum, California, and The Berman Museum at Ursinus College, Pennsylvania, as well as at storied Philadelphia artist collectives Vox Populi and Space 1026, of which she is a former member. She is represented by Jack Shainman Gallery and Fleisher/Ollman Gallery. Her solo exhibition Homemaker is currently on view at Jack Shainman Gallery through June 3rd.
